Module 2, finishing lesson 2, starting lesson 3 - 27/10/2020

Caught up with what we should have done last time
New teacher Luke
Taught about class / IDs
Shown Div classes
Given some rescources such as m1mo, various websites for reference
Ran through a few tasks such as creating text in different div classes 
Went over css stuff for a tags such as hover and focus
Few tricks such as "div#hello" to create a div tag with the #hello id
        
Overall a much more focused lesson and took a lot more in. Keeping up okay but sometimes takes a little while on the tasks but I think thats down to my setup of using a single monitor and trackpad.

Also, gave up on creating new branches as its a bit of a faff to do everytime we do a small task, will reuse them once we get bigger tasks where it will actually be beneficial to.
